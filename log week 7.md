# what I was trying to do
I tried to read amd understand the readings and made an attempt at the Raise the Dead I task.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing
It isn't quite research but as I continue to work in the course I can't help but think about Facebook's recent rebranding, which was also briefly discussed in the discord.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Tried to build model 
	+ was somewhat confused with instructions and due to a very busy work schedule this week failed to make any progress on this.

## challenges 
My biggest challenge was honestly just trying to sort out my sleep schedule which between my classes and work was very inconsistent and had a rather negative impact on all of my work this week.
## thoughts on where to go next

I have a very lax work schedule this upcoming week so I plan to engage with the tutorials as thoroughly as possibly with this extra time.
