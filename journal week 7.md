## Resonances

 "I am no “digital guru” – I do use and see the merits of various technologies and databases and advocate for Open Context etc. . . . but there are many folks better versed than I in the topics.” (Morag, 2016)

## Response to the Prompts

The potential for the future of archaeology in regards to the use and development of digital archaeological tools is both intriguing and in some ways worrying. There is an aspect of archaeology that I feel is very dependent on the physical presence and work, which is an integral part to some of the most important reasons for the practice. Archaeology is more than simply cataloguing and analysis and putting too much focus on the digital aspects of the field rather than the field as a whole has the ability to also shift focus away from aspects such as maintenance and restoration of sites.
